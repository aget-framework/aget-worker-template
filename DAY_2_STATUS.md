# Day 2 Status - September 25, 2025

## ✅ Completed

### Morning Session (Task 2.1-2.2)
- ✅ Pre-flight checks: All passed
- ✅ Renamed agent-music → spotify-aget
- ✅ Applied AGET v2 with advanced template
- ✅ Manually added patterns and AGET v2 components

### Afternoon Session (Task 2.3-2.4)
- ✅ Tested core patterns:
  - Wake: PASS (via pattern)
  - Wind-down: PASS (session preserved)
  - Housekeeping: PASS (27 items identified)
  - Documentation: PASS (Grade B)
  - Performance: PASS (0.019s)
- ✅ Created detailed migration report

## 🐛 Issues Found

### Critical
1. **Session protocol scripts fail** with KeyError on 'session_count'
   - Impact: Scripts unusable without fix
   - Workaround: Use patterns directly

### Minor
1. Installer lacks "agent" template option
2. --with-patterns flag doesn't include patterns
3. Custom CLAUDE.md content overwritten

## 📊 Metrics
- Migration time: ~20 minutes
- Patterns working: 5/5 tested (100%)
- Scripts working: 0/2 (0% - fixable)
- Performance: 0.019s (95% faster than target)
- Success rate: 75%

## 📋 Day 2 Summary
- [x] spotify-aget migrated
- [x] Core patterns validated
- [x] Performance exceeded targets
- [x] Migration report created
- [ ] Scripts need initialization fix
- [ ] Custom content needs merge

## 🚦 Go/No-Go Status: **YELLOW**
- Core functionality works via patterns
- Script issues are fixable
- Can proceed to Day 3 with known workarounds

## Key Learnings
1. **Patterns are robust** - Work independently of scripts
2. **Scripts need better initialization** - Session state fragile
3. **Performance excellent** - 95% faster than requirements
4. **Template system incomplete** - Missing "agent" option
5. **Manual fallbacks work** - Can copy patterns directly

## Recommendations for Day 3
1. Test llm-judge-aget with "tool" approach (use standard template)
2. Test planner-aget with hybrid approach
3. Document script initialization fix
4. Focus on pattern validation over scripts

## Next Steps
- Day 3: Test remaining projects with lessons learned
- Create script initialization fix
- Document pattern-first approach
- Update installer for better template support

*Day 2 Partial Success: Patterns work perfectly, scripts need fixes*
*Ready for Day 3 with workarounds documented*
