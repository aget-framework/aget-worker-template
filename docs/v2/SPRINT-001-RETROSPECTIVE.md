# Sprint 001 Retrospective

**Sprint**: 001 - Gate 1 Core CLI
**Duration**: ~19 hours (actual)
**Date**: 2025-09-22
**Outcome**: ✅ GO Decision - v2.0-alpha released

## What Went Well

### 1. Three-Tier Degradation Pattern
- Clean implementation of ADR-004
- All tiers working correctly
- Performance well under 2s requirement

### 2. Gate-Based Release Strategy
- Clear Go/No-Go decision point
- All 5 criteria passed on first attempt
- Immediate value delivery (dogfooding same day)

### 3. Test-Driven Gate Validation
- Automated gate validation suite
- Clear pass/fail criteria
- Confidence in release decision

## What Could Be Improved

### 1. Documentation Gaps
**Issue**: Gate→Release mapping not documented upfront
**Impact**: Confusion about which gates produce releases
**Fix Applied**: Updated PROJECT_PLAN.md with explicit release points
**Learning**: Every gate should declare its release intent

### 2. Cross-Project Dependencies Not Detected
**Issue**: Scanner didn't detect dangerous symlinks between projects
**Impact**: Nearly corrupted CCB configuration during dogfooding
**Fix Applied**: Enhanced scanner with cross-project risk detection
**Learning**: Scanners must check for unexpected external dependencies

### 3. Missing ADR for Gate 3
**Issue**: No clear rationale for why Gate 3 has no release
**Impact**: Questioned during review
**Fix Applied**: Added rationale to PROJECT_PLAN.md
**Learning**: Every deviation from pattern needs documentation

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Option A for Degradation**: Built into core architecture (not added per-command)
2. **Gates as Releases**: Each gate that produces working software gets a release
3. **Dogfood First**: aget-cli-agent-template before other projects
4. **RKB Last**: Most critical project migrates only after full validation

## Metrics

### Performance
- aget init: 0.4s average ✅
- aget rollback: 0.15s average ✅
- Gate validation: All tests <2s ✅

### Quality
- Gate 1 Criteria: 5/5 passed
- Test Coverage: Core commands tested
- Dogfooding: Immediate same-day deployment

### Velocity
- Planned: ~48 hours (Phase 1)
- Actual: ~19 hours (Sprint 001)
- Efficiency: 2.5x faster than estimated

## Action Items for Phase 2

1. **Add to Scanner**:
   - [ ] Detect circular symlinks
   - [ ] Check for hardcoded paths
   - [ ] Validate .gitignore entries

2. **Documentation Standards**:
   - [ ] Gate definition template
   - [ ] Release criteria checklist
   - [ ] Migration readiness scorecard

3. **Testing Improvements**:
   - [ ] Performance regression tests
   - [ ] Cross-platform validation
   - [ ] Backup integrity verification

## Surprises

### Positive
- Performance much better than expected (<0.5s vs <2s requirement)
- Clean architecture made implementation straightforward
- Dogfooding revealed issues immediately

### Negative
- Symlink configuration mess in aget-cli-agent-template
- CCB almost affected by cross-project dependency
- Gate 3 release confusion

## Team Sentiment

Working with clear gates and criteria made the sprint focused and productive. The Go/No-Go decision was objective and confidence-building. Ready for Phase 2 with lessons learned.

## Quote of the Sprint

> "Gates as releases is liberating, not constraining - it forces us to ship working software, not perfect software."
