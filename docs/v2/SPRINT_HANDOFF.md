# Sprint Handoff Protocol

**Purpose**: Maintain continuity between work sessions and prevent alignment issues.

## Current Handoff: Sprint 001 â†’ Sprint 002

### Sprint 001 Summary
- **Completed**: Gate 1 passed, v2.0-alpha released
- **Delivered**: 2 working commands (init, rollback), 3 placeholders
- **Performance**: <0.5s (exceeded <2s requirement)
- **Deployed**: Dogfooding on aget-cli-agent-template

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Placeholders Acceptable**: Gate 1 criteria interpreted as "execute without error" not "fully implemented"
2. **Architecture First**: Prioritized proving architecture over full command implementation
3. **Early Release**: Ship v2.0-alpha with partial functionality rather than wait

### Technical State
```
Working Commands:
- aget init: Full three-tier implementation
- aget rollback: Complete with --list option

Placeholder Commands:
- aget validate: Returns success, no validation logic
- aget apply: Returns success, no application logic
- aget list: Returns success, no listing logic

Architecture:
- BaseCommand pattern established
- Three-tier degradation working
- Performance optimized
```

### Sprint 002 Starting Point
- Pattern library is top priority
- 3 placeholder commands need real functionality
- 5+ patterns to be implemented
- Target: v2.0-beta release at Gate 2

### Known Issues/Debt
- Cross-project symlinks detected in scanner (fixed)
- Documentation inconsistencies (being addressed)
- No pattern authoring guide yet

### Files to Read First
1. `docs/v2/SPRINT-002-GATE2.md` - Current sprint plan
2. `docs/v2/GATE-1-ACTUAL.md` - What really happened
3. `RELEASE_NOTES_v2.0-alpha.md` - Current release state
