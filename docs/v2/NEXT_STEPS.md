# Next Steps - Post Sprint 001

**Date**: 2025-09-22
**Current Status**: v2.0-alpha released and dogfooding
**Next Target**: Phase 2 / Gate 2 â†’ v2.0-beta

## Immediate Actions (This Week)

### 1. Dogfood v2.0-alpha
- [ ] Use `./aget.sh` daily on aget-cli-agent-template
- [ ] Document any issues or friction points
- [ ] Test backup/rollback in real scenarios

### 2. Monitor CCB Compatibility
- [ ] Verify CCB continues working with v1
- [ ] Test v2 commands don't interfere
- [ ] Consider migration timing

### 3. Protect GM-RKB
- [ ] Do NOT migrate yet
- [ ] Wait for v2.0-beta minimum
- [ ] Keep monitoring for risks

## Phase 2 Sprint Planning (Gate 2)

### Target: Pattern Library (~35 hours)

**Core Patterns to Implement**:
1. session-management (wake/wind/sign-off)
2. testing-protocols (run tests, validate)
3. housekeeping (clean, organize)
4. documentation (check, update)
5. git-integration (commit, push, branch)
6. error-handling (recover, rollback)
7. file-management (backup, archive)
8. environment-config (env vars, paths)
9. business-rules (conflicts, dependencies)
10. agent-coordination (multi-agent)

### Gate 2 Success Criteria
- [ ] 10+ patterns validated
- [ ] Conflicts detected correctly
- [ ] Business rules enforced
- [ ] Suggestion algorithm works
- [ ] <2 second performance maintained

### Release: v2.0-beta
- For close collaborators
- Pattern library functional
- Migration path clearer

## Technical Debt from Sprint 001

### High Priority
1. Add `aget validate` command implementation
2. Create proper CLI entry point (not just aget.sh)
3. Add pip installation support

### Medium Priority
1. Cross-platform testing (Windows via WSL)
2. Performance benchmarks automation
3. Integration test suite

### Low Priority
1. Logo/branding for v2
2. Website/documentation site
3. Video tutorials

## Migration Strategy

### Week 1-2: Dogfood
- aget-cli-agent-template only
- Gather real usage data
- Fix critical issues

### Week 3-4: CCB Migration
- After patterns stabilized
- Test alongside music agent
- Document migration process

### Week 5+: GM-RKB
- Only after CCB success
- Full backup strategy
- Gradual rollout

## Risk Monitoring

### Watch For
- [ ] Performance degradation >2s
- [ ] Backup corruption issues
- [ ] Cross-project contamination
- [ ] Pattern conflicts

### Mitigation Ready
- Scanner detects risks
- Rollback tested
- Backup system proven

## Success Metrics to Track

### Usage
- Commands run per day
- Rollback frequency
- Error rate

### Performance
- Command response times
- Pattern application speed
- Scanner run time

### Quality
- Issues discovered
- Patterns that stick
- User satisfaction (you!)

## The Big Picture

**Where we are**: Foundation laid, core working
**Where we're going**: Rich pattern library
**End goal**: All projects using v2, safe and efficient

**Remember**: Gates create releases, releases create value!
