# ADR Publication Commitment

**Date**: 2025-09-22
**Decision**: Make ADRs public with appropriate safeguards

## Commitment

We commit to publishing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as a contribution to the open source community, recognizing both the value and risks of sharing architectural decisions.

## Publication Principles

### 1. Educational Value First
ADRs are published to help others learn from our decisions, especially patterns that address common problems.

### 2. Context Over Prescription
ADRs document decisions in context. They are not universal truths or prescriptions for all projects.

### 3. Privacy Protection
All ADRs undergo sanitization before publication:
- Private repository names removed
- Personal identifiable information (PII) scrubbed
- Generic examples replace specific ones
- Sensitive architectural details abstracted

### 4. Status Transparency
Each ADR clearly indicates its status:
- **Proposed**: Ideas under consideration
- **Accepted**: Active decisions
- **Deprecated**: No longer valid
- **Superseded**: Replaced by newer decisions

## High-Value Patterns for Public Sharing

Based on community need and novelty:

1. **Three-Tier Degradation Pattern** (ADR-004)
   - Novel approach to universal compatibility
   - Solves "works on my machine" problem

2. **No Test Theater** (ADR-007)
   - Addresses widespread problem of test infrastructure without tests
   - "Test coverage proportional to data value" principle

3. **Quality Agent Architecture** (ADR-008)
   - Progressive enforcement pattern
   - Educational before punitive approach

## Risk Mitigation

### Misinterpretation Risk
**Mitigation**: Clear context headers on each ADR stating they are point-in-time decisions, not universal prescriptions.

### Over-Commitment Risk
**Mitigation**: Status markers and "decisions not promises" disclaimer.

### PII Exposure Risk
**Mitigation**: Sanitization checklist applied before publication:
- [ ] No private repo names
- [ ] No personal paths (/Users/name)
- [ ] No company-specific details
- [ ] Generic examples only

### Premature Opinion Risk
**Mitigation**: v2.0-alpha decisions marked as "early stage" with expectation of evolution.

## Review Process

Before publication:
1. Author sanitizes ADR
2. Review for PII/sensitive info
3. Verify generic examples work
4. Add publication notice if needed
5. Update README index

## Community Benefit

Publishing ADRs provides:
- **Learning Material**: Real decisions with rationale
- **Pattern Library**: Reusable architectural patterns
- **Trust Building**: Transparency in design process
- **Feedback Loop**: Community can improve decisions

## Not Doing

- Not publishing internal/experimental ADRs until proven
- Not including client/employer-specific decisions
- Not presenting ADRs as "best practices" (they're contextual decisions)

## Success Metrics

- ADRs cited by other projects
- Community contributions to patterns
- Reduction in "test theater" anti-pattern
- Adoption of three-tier degradation pattern

## Quote

> "Share the thinking, not just the code. ADRs document the 'why' that makes the 'what' make sense."
