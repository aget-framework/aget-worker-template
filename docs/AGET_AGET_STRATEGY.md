# aget-aget Development Strategy

**Status**: Private Development Phase
**Timeline**: Now through AGET v3.0
**Repository**: Private (gmelli/aget-aget or similar)

## Strategic Vision

aget-aget will be developed privately as an innovation lab, then released publicly as a proven contribution gateway for the AGET framework.

## Three-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Private Innovation Lab (Current)
**Timeline**: Now â†’ AGET v3.0
**Status**: Private repository
**Focus**: Experimentation and discovery

Activities:
- Gabor tests Path 2 contribution workflows
- Extract patterns from real projects
- Build generalization tools
- Develop quality gates
- Create attribution system
- Learn what actually works

Benefits:
- Freedom to experiment
- No premature optimization
- Rapid iteration
- Build valuable pattern library

### Phase 2: Selective Reveal (AGET v3.0)
**Timeline**: With v3.0 release
**Status**: Announcement without full release
**Focus**: Demonstrate value

The reveal:
- "We've been using aget-aget internally"
- "Here are 50 patterns it helped us discover"
- "It enabled these framework improvements"
- Creates anticipation for public release

### Phase 3: Public Innovation Gateway (Post v3.0)
**Timeline**: After proven success
**Status**: Open source release
**Focus**: Community contributions

What gets released:
- Battle-tested tool
- Proven workflows
- Rich pattern library
- Complete documentation
- Success stories

## Repository Structure

### AGET (Public - Current)
Contains:
- Framework code
- Core patterns
- Templates
- ADRs about framework design
- Public documentation

ADRs here answer: "How does AGET work?"

### aget-aget (Private - Future)
Will contain:
- Contribution tools
- Pattern extractors
- Generalization logic
- Quality validators
- Attribution system
- ADRs about contribution process

ADRs here answer: "How do we improve AGET?"

## Migration Plan for ADR-004

Current location: `aget-cli-agent-template/docs/adr/004-aget-aget-contribution-gateway.md`

Future location: `aget-aget/docs/adr/001-contribution-gateway-vision.md`

When aget-aget goes public:
1. Move ADR-004 to aget-aget as founding document
2. Add implementation ADRs in aget-aget
3. Keep reference in AGET pointing to aget-aget

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (Private)
- Number of patterns extracted
- Time to extract and generalize
- Quality of generated tests
- Personal workflow efficiency

### Phase 2 (Reveal)
- Community reaction
- Interest in contribution model
- Requests for access
- Pattern adoption rate

### Phase 3 (Public)
- Contributors onboarded
- Patterns contributed
- Framework improvements
- Community growth

## Why Private-First Works

### For Development
- **Experimentation**: Try wild ideas without judgment
- **Learning**: Discover real needs through usage
- **Quality**: Build something worth sharing
- **Speed**: No documentation/support overhead

### For Strategy
- **Competitive advantage**: Unique patterns during private phase
- **Proof of concept**: Show results, not promises
- **Marketing story**: "Here's what we built with it"
- **Community value**: Release mature tool, not experiment

### For Innovation
- **Freedom**: Change anything without breaking users
- **Focus**: Build for real needs, not imagined ones
- **Iteration**: Rapid cycles without compatibility concerns
- **Discovery**: Find unexpected use cases

## Key Decisions

1. **aget-aget stays private** until meaningful value proven
2. **No public promises** about aget-aget until ready
3. **Focus on extraction** from real projects first
4. **Document learnings** privately for future release
5. **Build pattern library** as proof of value

## Next Steps

1. Create private aget-aget repository
2. Start with manual pattern extraction
3. Document pain points
4. Build first automation tools
5. Extract 5-10 patterns as proof of concept

*"Build in private, release with proof."*

This strategy allows aget-aget to mature naturally through real usage before becoming a public innovation. The community benefits from a proven tool rather than an experiment.
